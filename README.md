# Cryptocurrency-Price-Prediction-Using-LSTM
In this project, I applied advanced data science and machine learning techniques to predict future cryptocurrency prices from historical data, showcasing my ability to handle real-world, time-series data. The core steps involved data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation, and the visualization of results.

Successfully loaded and preprocessed time-series cryptocurrency data from CSV files using pandas, and transformed data for optimal analysis by conducting feature selection, handling date-time conversion, standardization using StandardScaler, and splitting into training and testing sets.

Built and trained an LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) model using Keras, demonstrating the use of sequential models, LSTM layers, Dropout, and Dense layers. The model was trained with 'adam' optimizer and 'mse' as the loss function.

Evaluated the model performance using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The model's prediction results were visualized with Matplotlib, aiding the interpretation of its performance. Achieved a high degree of accuracy in the model's predictions, as evidenced by a commendable RMSE score and R-squared value
